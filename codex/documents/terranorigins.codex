    "Humanity was a flourishing species with a high evolution rate and extremely hardy in terms of healing, recovery and endurance. they were the first race to engage in space travel, both for science and entertainment, but their limitations restricted them to their own solar system.",

    "Eventually, a privately funded group of scientists, explorers, engineers, soldiers and even civilians created the first manned mission out of the solar system with an experimental FTL drive. And eventually settled down in a colony they named, Terran. A new home. A new hope for humanity."
